Since its creation, alcohol has been a staple in human society. Every country at some point in history has drunk alcohol and today most countries still do. The difference between then and now is the change in restrictions on alcohol. While few countries like Kuwait have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-kuwait-islamists-alcohol-20150105-story.html#:~:text=Kuwait%20and%20Saudi%20Arabia%20are,people%20convicted%20of%20drinking%20alcohol">absolute bans on alcohol</a>, many have regulations in place to limit the amount of alcohol consumption for their citizens. The exact reasoning for these restrictions changes depending on the country but the general thought process is that when individuals consume less alcohol, they are better, more productive citizens. 

We want to challenge this reasoning by determining if a country's alcohol consumption impacts a country's gross domestic product (GDP). While a country's GDP is not a perfect reflection of the productivity of a country, there is enough correlation between the two that an analysis can be conducted.
